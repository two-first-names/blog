Bit late for this one, though not a huge amount happened last week so I feel justified.

Biggest deal this week was a meeting with HR and the Neurodiversity Network, discussing how to support neurodiverse people in the recruitment process.

It went really well, though not enough time to discuss everything, another meeting is likely in the works, with the possibility of turning this into a project group. A big thing I want to talk about is how I was recruited to GDS, it took a long time and I'm sure that would push away many people.

Other things I did this week:
- Met with the Lead SRE in my area, had a really good chat, putting some things into motion.
- Ranted at length about AWS not properly supporting services but expecting them to be used and pushing for vendor lock-in. Maybe I'll do a blog post about this...
- Built a quick prototype Slack webhook for working with Codebuild notifications, related to the above rant. Probably not going to go anywhere with it, I'd prefer AWS to just fix their broken system.
